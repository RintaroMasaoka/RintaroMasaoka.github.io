## About me
I am Rintaro Masaoka (政岡凜太郎), a master's student in condensed matter theory and statistical physics.
My research focuses on quantum phase transitions, with a particular interest in quantum critical phenomena characterized by nontrivial dynamical exponents.

## Reserch topic

### Non relativistic critical points
Conformal field theory (CFT) has been successful in describing universal aspects of critical phenomena. 
However, its applicability is largely restricted to Lorentz-invariant systems in $(d+1)$ dimensions or isotropic critical points in $d$-dimensional statistical models.

I'm interested in non-relativistic (or anisotropic) critical phenomena, which satisfy Lifshitz scale invariance:
$$
𝒙 ↦ λ𝒙,\quad t ↦ λ^z,
$$
where $z$ is called dynamical exponent.
